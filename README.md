## Object-Oriented Programming in C++ course

[Syllabus](http://bluebook.physics.manchester.ac.uk/10_syllabuses/physics_level3/phys_30762.html): 

* The basic properties of C++: constants; boolean data-types; pointers and references; dynamic memory allocation; function overloading.
* Data streams: standard input/output; managing files.
* Classes and objects: encapsulation; access functions; constructors and destructors; arrays of objects; friends; operator overloading; assignment operator; shallow and deep copying; this pointer.
* Inheritance: base and derived classes; access specifiers; overriding functions; multiple inheritance.
* Polymorphism: base class pointers; abstract base classes; virtual and pure virtual functions; interface classes.
* Structuring programs: header files; multiple source files; namespaces.
* Advanced C++ features: static data; templates; runtime type checking; error handling.
* The C++ Standard Library; the boost library; other libraries.

### Object-Oriented Programming in C++ Project:
### An Experimental Data Management System

Experimental data management system DataHero implements a class hierarchy for storing experimental data as well as an interactive, terminal-based user interface. DataHero allows user to compute means and standard errors of repeated measurements, supports real and complex data types and reads input from file(s) or screen. A range of C++ and object- oriented design features have been investigated and used: inheritance and polymorphism, virtual methods, static class members, template functions and classes, sequence containers (vectors and lists), associative containers (maps and multimaps) and smart pointers (unique, shared and weak). The code is organised in multiple source and header files. Exception management ensures error handling. The user interface features two menus: main menu navigates user through the data analysis process and help menu provides the DataHero usage instructions.
